# Carbon Reduction
_A Case Study on ZPOT Kaeokla for You Project_

## Background
Kaeokla for You is a carbon emision reduction and CO2 reduction project run by Zoological Park Organization of Thailand (ZPOT), a governmental agency under Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmnet, operated by Yada Kaeosod. She consulted me on the carbon outcome of the project. Hence, I developed a web application deployed at https://esc.mnre.go.th/app/co2 to make it easier to calculate the potential project outcome: Carbon emission reduction and sequestration.
