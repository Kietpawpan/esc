The e-Request Project is the first web application 
development effort aimed at creating a robust 
e-service on the Elastic Cloud Server under the 
Government Data Center and Cloud Service Project, 
by the MNRE Service Link Center. The project is 
solely managed by a group of civil servants 
at the Service Link Center.

In 2024, six core contributors formed the developer team:

   Montri Kiatphaophan     
   Prachakchai Atkonghan      
   Tatsani Detchaprorom
   Phiphat Puengbun	   
   Chirapon Kanchanaaramwong  
   Chirapha Hasunheng

MNRE officials who tested the e-Request system
